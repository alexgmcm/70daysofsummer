\chapter{Analysis and Evaluation}

Despite the early positive results from the RMSE values of the linear regression model once the classes did not appear to be separable in the visualisations produced it seemed unlikely that the classification attempt would be highly successful. Although previous work \cite{Gomez2013} had related the relative powers to the age of the subject via a quadratic relationship, an attempt to fit a quadratic model to the data we had was less successful than the linear model. It is worth noting that the previous study investigated the relative powers as a function of age, looking at each relative power band separately and thus it simple linear regression rather than multiple regression, and our study investigated the age as a function of the relative powers. The difference are because of the different aims of the studies, they were investigating the effect of age on the relative powers, whereas we were attempting to predict the age from the relative powers.\\

Although the RMSE values obtained from the linear model do agree with our expectations (the healthy data has significantly less error than the MCI data which has less error than the AD data),
