@article{Bushati2011,
abstract = {The complexity of gene expression data generated from microarrays and high-throughput sequencing make their analysis challenging. One goal of these analyses is to define sets of co-regulated genes and identify patterns of gene expression. To date, however, there is a lack of easily implemented methods that allow an investigator to visualize and interact with the data in an intuitive and flexible manner. Here, we show that combining a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, t-statistic Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), with a novel visualization technique provides a graphical mapping that allows the intuitive investigation of transcriptome data. This approach performs better than commonly used methods, offering insight into underlying patterns of gene expression at both global and local scales and identifying clusters of similarly expressed genes. A freely available MATLAB-implemented graphical user interface to perform t-SNE and nearest neighbour plots on genomic data sets is available at www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/research/james-briscoe/visgenex.},

This study used direct observation methods and systematic time sampling to examine temporal patterns of negative and positive behavior in 177 residents of 2 long-term care facilities with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD). The authors found small statistically significant diurnal variation in both negative and positive behavior, characterized by a curvilinear pattern with a single peak. This pattern was unaffected by seasonal differences in length of day, severity of cognitive impairment, level of behavior, or sleep disturbances. Time when behavior peaked differed by type of behavior and by facility, and there was substantial heterogeneity in behavior patterns.},

Unlike most prior work that defines projections based on their statistical properties, our approach creates projection functions that align with user-specified annotations. Therefore, the resulting derived dimensions represent concepts defined by the user's examples. These especially crafted projection functions, or explainers, can help find and explain relationships between the data variables and user-designated concepts. They can organize the data according to these concepts. Sets of explainers can provide multiple perspectives on the data. Our approach considers tradeoffs in choosing these projection functions, including their simplicity, expressive power, alignment with prior knowledge, and diversity. We provide techniques for creating collections of explainers. The methods, based on machine learning optimization frameworks, allow exploring the tradeoffs. We demonstrate our approach on model problems and applications in text analysis.},

@article{Gross2013,
abstract = {Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings are a rich source of information about the neural dynamics underlying cognitive processes in the brain, with excellent temporal and good spatial resolution. In recent years there have been considerable advances in MEG hardware developments and methods. Sophisticated analysis techniques are now routinely applied and continuously improved, leading to fascinating insights into the intricate dynamics of neural processes. However, the rapidly increasing level of complexity of the different steps in a MEG study make it difficult for novices, and sometimes even for experts, to stay aware of possible limitations and caveats. Furthermore, the complexity of MEG data acquisition and data analysis requires special attention when describing MEG studies in publications, in order to facilitate interpretation and reproduction of the results. This manuscript aims at making recommendations for a number of important data acquisition and data analysis steps and suggests details that should be specified in manuscripts reporting MEG studies. These recommendations will hopefully serve as guidelines that help to strengthen the position of the MEG research community within the field of neuroscience, and may foster discussion in order to further enhance the quality and impact of MEG research.},

abstract = {This study assesses the connectivity alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in magnetoencephalogram (MEG) background activity. Moreover, a novel methodology to adaptively extract brain rhythms from the MEG is introduced. This methodology relies on the ability of empirical mode decomposition to isolate local signal oscillations and constrained blind source separation to extract the activity that jointly represents a subset of channels. Inter-regional MEG connectivity was analysed for 36 AD, 18 MCI and 26 control subjects in $\delta$, $\theta$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands over left and right central, anterior, lateral and posterior regions with magnitude squared coherence-c(f). For the sake of comparison, c(f) was calculated from the original MEG channels and from the adaptively extracted rhythms. The results indicated that AD and MCI cause slight alterations in the MEG connectivity. Computed from the extracted rhythms, c(f) distinguished AD and MCI subjects from controls with 69.4\% and 77.3\% accuracies, respectively, in a full leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation. These values were higher than those obtained without the proposed extraction methodology.},

abstract = {The frequency spectrum of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) background activity was analysed in 15 schizophrenia (SCH) patients with predominant positive symptoms and 17 age-matched healthy control subjects using the following variables: median frequency (MF), spectral entropy (SpecEn) and relative power in delta (RP$\delta$), theta (RP$\theta$), lower alpha (RP$\alpha$1), upper alpha (RP$\alpha$2), beta (RP$\beta$) and gamma (RP$\gamma$) bands. We found significant differences between the two subject groups in the average level of MF and RP$\gamma$ in some regions of the scalp. Additionally, the MF, SpecEn, RP$\beta$ and RP$\gamma$ values of SCH patients with positive symptoms had a different dependence on age as compared with the results of control subjects, suggesting that SCH affects the way in which the brain activity evolves with age. Moreover, we also classified the MEG signals by means of a cross-validated feature selection process followed by a logistic regression. The subjects were classified with 71.3\% accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 0.741. Thus, the spectral and classification analysis of the MEG in SCH may provide insights into how this condition affects the brain activity and may help in its early detection.},

EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu.

abstract = {The objective of the study was to optimize the formulation parameters of cytarabine liposomes by using artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple regression analysis using 3(3) factorial design (FD). As model formulations, 27 formulations were prepared. The formulation variables, drug (cytarabine)/lipid (phosphatidyl choline [PC] and cholesterol [Chol]) molar ratio (X1), PC/Chol in percentage ratio of total lipids (X2), and the volume of hydration medium (X3) were selected as the independent variables; and the percentage drug entrapment (PDE) was selected as the dependent variable. A set of causal factors was used as tutorial data for ANN and fed into a computer. The optimization was performed by minimizing the generalized distance between the predicted values of each response and the optimized one that was obtained individually. In case of 3(3) factorial design, a second-order full-model polynomial equation and a reduced model were established by subjecting the transformed values of independent variables to multiple regression analysis, and contour plots were drawn using the equation. The optimization methods developed by both ANN and FD were validated by preparing another 5 liposomal formulations. The predetermined PDE and the experimental data were compared with predicted data by paired t test, no statistically significant difference was observed. ANN showed less error compared with multiple regression analysis. These findings demonstrate that ANN provides more accurate prediction and is quite useful in the optimization of pharmaceutical formulations when compared with the multiple regression analysis method.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this pilot study, we intended to assess whether a procedure based on blind source separation (BSS) and subsequent partial reconstruction of magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings might enhance the differences between MEGs from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and elderly control subjects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed MEG background activity recordings acquired with a 148-channel whole-head magnetometer from 21 AD patients and 21 control subjects. Artefact-free epochs of 20 s were blindly decomposed using the algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction (AMUSE), which arranges the extracted components by decreasing linear predictability. Thus, the components of diverse epochs and subjects could be easily compared. Every component was characterised with its median frequency and spectral entropy (denoted by fmedian and SpecEn, respectively). The differences between subject groups in these variables were statistically evaluated to find out which components could improve the subject classification. Then, these significant components were used to partially reconstruct the MEG recordings.

RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that the AMUSE components which provided the largest differences between demented patients and control subjects were ordered together. Considering this analysis, we defined two subsets, denoted by BSS-\{15,35\} and BSS-\{20,30\}, which included 21 components (15-35) and 11 components (20-30), respectively. We partially reconstructed the MEGs with these subsets. Then, the classification performance was computed with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure for the case where no BSS was applied and for the partial reconstructions BSS-\{15,35\} and BSS-\{20,30\}. The BSS and component selection procedure improved the classification accuracy from 69.05\% to 83.33\% using f(median) with BSS-\{15,35\} and from 61.91\% to 73.81\% using SpecEn with BSS-\{20,30\}.

CONCLUSION: These preliminary results lead us to think that the proposed procedure based on BSS and selection of significant components may improve the classification of AD patients using straightforward features from MEG recordings.},

Artefact-free epochs of 3392 samples were analysed with auto-mutual information (AMI). Average AMI decline rates were lower for the AD patients' recordings than for control subjects' ones. Statistically significant differences were found using a Student's t-test (p<0.01) in 144 channels. Mean AMI values were analysed with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of 75\%, 90.5\% and 82.9\% were obtained. Our results show that AMI estimations of the magnetic brain activity are different in both groups, hence indicating an abnormal type of dynamics associated with AD.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia in western countries. The rise in life expectancy will likely increase its prevalence, since ageing is the greatest known risk factor. Although an early and accurate identification is critical, low diagnostic accuracy is currently reached. Hence, the aim of the present study was to analyse the spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity from 148 channels in 20 AD patients and 21 healthy controls to extract discriminating spectral features. Relative power (RP) was calculated in conventional frequency bands and several ratios were defined to emphasise the differences in its distribution. Both RP values and spectral ratios were transformed with a principal component analysis to summarise information with minimal loss of variability. AD patients showed a significant increase of RP(delta) and RP(theta), along with a decrease of RP(beta) and RP(gamma). The most significant differences were reached by spectral ratios using the beta band. Specifically, we obtained 75.0\% sensitivity, 90.5\% specificity and 82.9\% accuracy (linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure), together with a p-value lower than 0.001 (one-way analysis of variance with age as a covariate) using the [RP(alpha)+RP(beta(1))+RP(beta(2))+RP(gamma)]/[RP(delta)+RP(theta)] ratio. The spectral ratios also showed a higher correlation with the severity of dementia than individual relative power measures. Our results suggest that the spectral ratios could be useful descriptors to help in the AD diagnosis, since they effectively summarise the slowing of the AD patients' MEG rhythms in individual indexes and correlate significantly with the severity of dementia.},

abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the real-time recording of neural activity and oscillatory activity in distributed neural networks. We applied a non-linear complexity analysis to resting-state neural activity as measured using whole-head MEG. Recordings were obtained from 20 unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder and 19 matched healthy controls. Subsequently, after 6 months of pharmacological treatment with the antidepressant mirtazapine 30 mg/day, patients received a second MEG scan. A measure of the complexity of neural signals, the Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), was derived from the MEG time series. We found that depressed patients showed higher pre-treatment complexity values compared with controls, and that complexity values decreased after 6 months of effective pharmacological treatment, although this effect was statistically significant only in younger patients. The main treatment effect was to recover the tendency observed in controls of a positive correlation between age and complexity values. Importantly, the reduction of complexity with treatment correlated with the degree of clinical symptom remission. We suggest that LZC, a formal measure of neural activity complexity, is sensitive to the dynamic physiological changes observed in depression and may potentially offer an objective marker of depression and its remission after treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined as the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, but an objective diagnostic test is not available yet to date. Neurophychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological research offer ample evidence of brain and behavioral dysfunctions in ADHD, but these findings have not been useful as a diagnostic test.

METHODS: Whole-head magnetoencephalographic recordings were obtained from 14 diagnosed ADHD patients and 14 healthy children during resting conditions. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) values were obtained for each channel and child and averaged in five sensor groups: anterior, central, left lateral, right lateral, and posterior.

RESULTS: Lempel-Ziv complexity scores were significantly higher in control subjects, with the maximum value in anterior region. Combining age and anterior complexity values allowed the correct classification of ADHD patients and control subjects with a 93\% sensitivity and 79\% specificity. Control subjects showed an age-related monotonic increase of LZC scores in all sensor groups, while children with ADHD exhibited a nonsignificant tendency toward decreased LZC scores. The age-related divergence resulted in a 100\% specificity in children older than 9 years.

CONCLUSIONS: Results support the role of a frontal hypoactivity in the diagnosis of ADHD. Moreover, the age-related divergence of complexity scores between ADHD patients and control subjects might reflect distinctive developmental trajectories. This interpretation of our results is in agreement with recent investigations reporting a delay of cortical maturation in the prefrontal cortex.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The neurodevelopmental-neurodegenerative debate is a basic issue in the field of the neuropathological basis of schizophrenia (SCH). Neurophysiological techniques have been scarcely involved in such debate, but nonlinear analysis methods may contribute to it.

METHODS: Fifteen patients (age range 23-42 years) matching DSM IV-TR criteria for SCH, and 15 sex- and age-matched control subjects (age range 23-42 years) underwent a resting-state magnetoencephalographic evaluation and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) scores were calculated.

RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that LZC values were strongly dependent on age. Complexity scores increased as a function of age in controls, while SCH patients exhibited a progressive reduction of LZC values. A logistic model including LZC scores, age and the interaction of both variables allowed the classification of patients and controls with high sensitivity and specificity.

CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated that SCH patients failed to follow the "normal" process of complexity increase as a function of age. In addition, SCH patients exhibited a significant reduction of complexity scores as a function of age, thus paralleling the pattern observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the notion of a progressive defect in SCH, which does not contradict the existence of a basic neurodevelopmental alteration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, we applied a novel procedure to calculate the mean frequency from the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals of 22 patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 21 healthy controls. A significant mean frequency decrease was expected in pathological groups. MCI subjects are expected to show intermediate mean frequency values between AD patients and controls.

METHODS: MEG signal was obtained from a whole-head 148 channels magnetometer in a resting condition. We estimated the power spectral density from the MEG signal by means of the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. Then, we computed the mean frequency for each subject.

RESULTS: Mean frequency was higher in controls (12.46 +/- 2.00 Hz, mean +/- SD) than in MCI subjects (10.82 +/- 2.21 Hz) with significant differences (P < 0.05). Moreover, mean frequency values in MCI subjects were higher than in AD patients (9.06 +/- 2.48 Hz, P < 0.05). We also detected a decrease of 0.17 Hz per year in mean frequency from normal subjects' MEG (P < 0.05)

CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated that the approach adopted for the calculation of a mean frequency score seems to be adequate and sensitive to detect differences between normal aging, cognitive deterioration and AD. In addition, data may contribute to the theoretical discussion on the nature of mild cognitive impairment and its similitudes with Alzheimer's disease.

SIGNIFICANCE: This paper may be considered a first step to obtain a reliable measure which summarizes spectral information, and might be of a potential clinical interest.},

abstract = {Complexity estimators have been broadly utilized in schizophrenia investigation. Early studies reported increased complexity in schizophrenia patients, associated with a higher variability or "irregularity" of their brain signals. However, further investigations showed reduced complexities, thus introducing a clear divergence. Nowadays, both increased and reduced complexity values are reported. The explanation of such divergence is a critical issue to understand the role of complexity measures in schizophrenia research. Considering previous arguments a complementary hypothesis is advanced: if the increased irregularity of schizophrenia patients' neurophysiological activity is assumed, a "natural" tendency to increased complexity in EEG and MEG scans should be expected, probably reflecting an abnormal neuronal firing pattern in some critical regions such as the frontal lobes. This "natural" tendency to increased complexity might be modulated by the interaction of three main factors: medication effects, symptomatology, and age effects.

More importantly, the investigation of these interacting factors by means of complexity estimators might help to elucidate some of the neuropathological processes involved in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Objectively to evaluate whether independent spike detection by human interpreters is clinically valid in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to characterize detection differences between MEG and scalp electroencephalography (EEG).

METHODS: We simultaneously recorded scalp EEG and MEG data from 43 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Raw EEG and MEG waveforms were reviewed independently by two experienced epileptologists, one for EEG and one for MEG, blinded to the other modality and to the clinical information. The number and localization of spikes detected by EEG and/or MEG were compared in relation to clinical diagnosis based on postoperative seizure freedom.

RESULTS: Interictal spikes were captured in both EEG and MEG in 31, in MEG alone in eight, in EEG alone in one, and in neither modality in three patients. The number of detections ranged widely with no statistical difference between modalities. A median of 25.7\% of total spikes was detectable by both modalities. Spike localization was similarly consistent with the epilepsy diagnosis in 85.2\% (EEG) and 78.1\% (MEG) of the patients. Inaccurate localization occurred only in those cases with very few spikes detected, especially when the detections were in one modality alone.

CONCLUSIONS: Interictal epileptiform discharges are easily perceived in MEG. Independent spike identification in MEG can provide clinical results comparable, but not superior, to EEG. Many spikes were seen in only one modality or the other; therefore the use of both EEG and MEG may provide additional information.},

The skull, scalp and brain tissue do not distort magnetic fields, so the cortical activity can be easily measured. MEG is starting to be used to explore the effects of various psychopharmacological agents on resting brain, sensory and cognitive processing. Scopolamine and agents enhancing GABA functions have shown differential effects on cortical neural oscillations. Further, with GABA, serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine transmissions have differential effects on early cortical and pre-attentional processing in the auditory and frontal cortices. Monoamines also differently regulate the activity of the somatosensory cortex. Taken together, MEG with a resolution of milliseconds allows exploration of focal cortical effects of psychopharmacological agents giving information different from other brain-imaging modalities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been available for over 30 years, but the past 10 years have seen serious investigation of its use as a clinical tool. It is therefore an opportune time to review how MEG is able to contribute to neuropsychiatric research and practice.

RECENT FINDINGS: We limit this review to the areas of dementia, schizophrenia, depression and autism. MEG can achieve correct classification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment versus Alzheimer's disease, may identify a marker of early disease in schizophrenia, can distinguish bipolar from major depressive disorder, and has been used to study cognitive and other deficits in autism. It provides a valuable tool to study cognitive dysfunction.

SUMMARY: The most important aspect of MEG is the ability to record neural activity with millisecond precision, allowing coherence analysis of neural data to examine how brain areas are synchronized. Such synchrony is thought to underlie cognitive processes. As cognitive dysfunction is a common marker of neuropsychiatric disorders, MEG is emerging as an important investigatory tool in neuropsychiatry. It may also be useful clinically for early or differential diagnosis of some neuropsychiatric disorders, or for the prediction of drug effects, but more research is necessary before this becomes a clinical reality.},

abstract = {Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered EEG with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications.},

MEG provides millisecond time resolution and allows real-time tracking of brain activation sequences during sensory processing, motor planning and action, cognition, language perception and production, social interaction, and various brain disorders. Current-day neuromagnetometers house hundreds of SQUIDs, superconducting quantum interference devices, to pick up signals generated by concerted action of cortical neurons. Complementary MEG measures of neuronal involvement include evoked responses, modulation of cortical rhythms, properties of the on-going neural activity, and interareal connectivity. Future MEG breakthroughs in understanding brain dynamics are expected through advanced signal analysis and combined use of MEG with hemodynamic imaging (fMRI).

These modalities offer the potential for functional brain mapping with temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, the limited number of spatial measurements and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem present significant limits to our ability to produce accurate spatial maps from these data without imposing major restrictions on the form of the inverse solution. Here we describe approaches to solving the forward problem of computing the mapping from putative inverse solutions into the data space. We then describe the inverse problem in terms of low dimensional solutions, based on the equivalent current dipole (ECD), and high dimensional solutions, in which images of neural activation are constrained to the cerebral cortex. We also address the issue of objective assessment of the relative performance of inverse procedures by the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We conclude with a discussion of methods for assessing statistical significance of experimental results through use of the bootstrap for determining confidence regions in dipole-fitting methods, and random field (RF) and permutation methods for detecting significant activation in cortically constrained imaging studies.},

The cerebral magnetic fields recorded noninvasively enable the accurate determination of locations of cerebral activity with an uncompromized time resolution. The first whole-scalp sensor arrays have just recently come into operation, and significant advances are to be expected in both neurophysiological and cognitive studies, as well as in clinical practice. However, although the accuracy of locating isolated sources of brain activity has improved, identification of multiple simultaneous sources can still be a problem. Therefore, attempts are being made to combine magnetoencephalography with other brain-imaging methods to improve spatial localization of multiple sources and, simultaneously, to achieve a more complete characterization of different aspects of brain activity during cognitive processing. Owing to its good time resolution and considerably better spatial accuracy than that provided by EEG, magnetoencephalography holds great promise as a tool for revealing information-processing sequences of the human brain.},

abstract = {This study investigated age-related changes in the human brain function using both traditional EEG analysis (power spectra) and the correlational dimension, a measure reflecting the complexity of EEG dynamics and, probably, the complexity of neurophysiological processes generating the EEG. Assuming that the accumulation of individual experience is determined by the formation of functionally related groups of neurons showing a repetitive synchronous activation (cell assemblies), an increase in the number of such independently oscillating cortical cell assemblies can be expected, despite a decline of some metabolic and memory functions with normal ageing. Thus, the "wisdom of old age' may find its neurophysiological basis in greater complexity of brain dynamics compared to young ages. The experimental hypothesis was that EEG dimension steadily increases with age. In order to test this hypothesis the resting EEGs of 5 age groups from 7 to 60 were analysed. The results confirm the hypothesis: after a jump in the brain dynamics complexity during puberty a linear increase with age is observed. During maturation (7-25 years), the maximum gain in complexity occurs over the frontal associative cortex.},

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

A historical timeline of each technique is outlined along with some illustrative applications. The most crucial underlying assumptions of the presented methodologies are discussed in order to help the reader understand where each technique fits into the bigger picture of measuring brain connectivity. In this endeavor, linear, nonlinear, causality-assessing and information-based techniques are summarized in the framework of measuring functional and effective connectivity. Model based vs. data-driven techniques and bivariate vs. multivariate methods are also discussed. Finally, certain important caveats (i.e. stationarity assumption) pertaining to the applicability of the methods are also illustrated along with some examples of clinical applications.},

abstract = {The field of electroencephalography (EEG) has witnessed a dramatic development during the last decade. The electroencephalogram that had been principally used as a 'post-hoc' diagnostic procedure is now fully used as an 'on-line' monitor of neural function with its excellent temporal resolution. Neurophysiological monitoring in the operating room, neurological intensive care unit (ICU) and during endovascular procedures allows early identification of impending neurological deficits before irreversible neurological impairment. Long-term monitoring of scalp and synchronized video-EEG recordings and invasive (depth and subdural) electrode studies are well-established tools in the localization of the epileptogenic region for identification of potential candidates for surgery. The advent of digital EEG with digital storage and the ability to manipulate data with digital reformatting, filter and sensitivity changes has allowed us to maximize the information and reduce artifacts. These changes have revolutionized the way in which EEG is performed and interpreted.},

abstract = {The frequency spectrum of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) background activity was analysed in 15 schizophrenia (SCH) patients with predominant positive symptoms and 17 age-matched healthy control subjects using the following variables: median frequency (MF), spectral entropy (SpecEn) and relative power in delta (RP$\delta$), theta (RP$\theta$), lower alpha (RP$\alpha$1), upper alpha (RP$\alpha$2), beta (RP$\beta$) and gamma (RP$\gamma$) bands. We found significant differences between the two subject groups in the average level of MF and RP$\gamma$ in some regions of the scalp. Additionally, the MF, SpecEn, RP$\beta$ and RP$\gamma$ values of SCH patients with positive symptoms had a different dependence on age as compared with the results of control subjects, suggesting that SCH affects the way in which the brain activity evolves with age. Moreover, we also classified the MEG signals by means of a cross-validated feature selection process followed by a logistic regression. The subjects were classified with 71.3\% accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 0.741. Thus, the spectral and classification analysis of the MEG in SCH may provide insights into how this condition affects the brain activity and may help in its early detection.},

@article{Fernandez2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Considering the increasing use of complexity estimates in neuropsychiatric populations, a normative study is critical to define the 'normal' behaviour of brain oscillatory complexity across the life span. METHOD: This study examines changes in resting-state magnetoencephalogram (MEG) complexity - quantified with the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm - due to age and gender in a large sample of 222 (100 males/122 females) healthy participants with ages ranging from 7 to 84 years. RESULTS: A significant quadratic (curvilinear) relationship (p<0.05) between age and complexity was found, with LZC maxima being reached by the sixth decade of life. Once that peak was crossed, complexity values slowly decreased until late senescence. Females exhibited higher LZC values than males, with significant differences in the anterior, central and posterior regions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the evolution of brain oscillatory complexity across the life span might be considered a new illustration of a 'normal' physiological rhythm. SIGNIFICANCE: Previous and forthcoming clinical studies using complexity estimates might be interpreted from a more complete and dynamical perspective. Pathologies not only cause an 'abnormal' increase or decrease of complexity values but they actually 'break' the 'normal' pattern of oscillatory complexity evolution as a function of age.},

abstract = {Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often difficult, especially early in the disease process at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Yet, it is at this stage that treatment is most likely to be effective, so there would be great advantages in improving the diagnosis process. We describe and test a machine learning approach for personalized and cost-effective diagnosis of AD. It uses locally weighted learning to tailor a classifier model to each patient and computes the sequence of biomarkers most informative or cost-effective to diagnose patients. Using ADNI data, we classified AD versus controls and MCI patients who progressed to AD within a year, against those who did not. The approach performed similarly to considering all data at once, while significantly reducing the number (and cost) of the biomarkers needed to achieve a confident diagnosis for each patient. Thus, it may contribute to a personalized and effective detection of AD, and may prove useful in clinical settings.},
