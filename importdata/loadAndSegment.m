%load data in little segments stored in segmentedData.trial cellarray (1x nSegs) of segment arrays (nChans*nSampPerSeg)
%if we do it one at a time then with a try statement to skip corruptions then we don't have to deal with them in an awkward way
%hopefully multiple loadMEGData calls won't be *too* much slower than a single call or few calls only where there are corruptions
%if this proves to be too slow can do this later

end
%this puts all the trials next to one another in the trial array even if they are not consecutive due to removal of corruptions
%their time vectors will show that they aren't consecutive - can easily change this to have empty entries if that turns out to be
%more convenient
